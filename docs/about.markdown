I started graduate school at the University of Waterloo in September, 2023. While my program started out as a course-based Master's, in May 2024 I have transferred into a research program. I currently work with the [Communication Security Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/communications-security-lab/) and conduct research about lattice-based cryptography.

In a previous chapter, I studied pure mathematics and statistics at UC Berkeley (Go Bears!). After finishing college, I worked at [LeanTaaS](https://leantaas.com) as a software engineer, where I built data warehouse and pipeline using AWS, Apache Airflow, and Python. 

My favorite tech stack (updated July, 2024)
- Rust is my go-to language, though I am still a noob
- I have a very rudimentary understanding of C, but could not build large project on my own, mostly because I haven't taken the time to learn `make`
- Python is my favorite scripting language for whipping out a quick proof-of-concept
- Neovim for most of programming. VSCode for HTML/Markdown/LaTeX. I personally prefer compiling LaTeX locally instead of using Overleaf, but sometimes there are collaborative projects or complicated templates that force my hands
- Some passing knowledge of web development. Can probably make a solid Flask/Django backend with some assistance from ChatGPT
- Would really like to learn Go for 2024's [AoC](https://adventofcode.com), would like to get some passing knowledge of C++

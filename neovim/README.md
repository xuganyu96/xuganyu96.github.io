Welcome to my Neovim setup. It is largely copied from [`kickstart.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) with minor modification to make it my own setup.

To get started, create a symlink from this directory to `~/.config/nvim`:

```bash
# from the repository root:
ln -s $(pwd)/neovim ~/.config/nvim
```
